## Problem Title
SIH 25006: Development of a Digital Farm Management Portal for implementing Biosecurity measures in Pig and Poultry Farms
## Problem Description
### Background

Biosecurity is a cornerstone of animal health management, particularly in the pig and poultry sectors, where disease outbreaks such as Avian Influenza and African Swine Fever can cause significant economic losses, threaten food security, and disrupt rural livelihoods. Despite its importance, many farmers—especially smallholders in resource-limited areas—struggle to access practical, actionable information on biosecurity protocols, risk assessment tools, and regulatory compliance requirements.

### Problem Description

There is an urgent need for a user-friendly, digital platform that empowers farmers to implement, monitor, and sustain robust biosecurity practices on their farms. This portal should offer end-to-end solutions for farm-level biosecurity management by integrating:

• Customizable risk assessment tools based on local epidemiological conditions.
• Interactive training modules and best practice guidelines tailored for pig and poultry production systems.
• Compliance tracking features aligned with regulatory frameworks to help farmers work toward disease-free compartment recognition.
• Real-time alerts and monitoring dashboards for disease outbreaks and biosecurity breaches.
• Multilingual and mobile-first design to ensure accessibility in remote and rural areas.

The platform should also enable data collection and analysis for policy support, foster collaborative networking among stakeholders (farmers, veterinarians, extension workers, etc.), and promote long-term resilience and sustainability in the livestock sector.

### Expected Outcomes

• Enhanced farmer awareness and education on biosecurity.
• Improved risk management at the farm level as well as self-assessment.
• Easy access to customized biosecurity protocols and guidelines.
• Digital record-keeping and compliance tracking.
• Timely alerts and disease notifications to farmers.
• Healthier livestock and increased farm productivity.
• Empowerment of small and marginal farmers with limited resources.
• Support to authorities in data-driven surveillance and policy making.
• Stronger collaboration across the livestock ecosystem.
• Improved national preparedness for zoonotic and transboundary diseases.

## Proposed Solution

Our solution is a simple and user-friendly digital portal called BioSecureFarm that helps pig and poultry farmers follow proper biosecurity practices. It provides tools for risk assessment, guidelines, training, and monitoring. The portal supports multiple languages so farmers in rural areas can easily understand and use it.

## How It Addresses the Problem

Farmers often lack awareness about diseases and biosecurity steps. This portal offers clear instructions, alerts, and checklists that guide them step-by-step. It helps farmers understand their risks and improve their farm conditions. It also supports government monitoring and early disease detection.

## Innovation and Uniqueness

The portal uses an AI-based risk score, simple training videos, offline access, and real-time alerts about disease outbreaks. It also keeps digital records and provides automatic reports for compliance. These features make it more advanced and useful compared to normal farm apps.

## Technical Approach

The system will be built using web and mobile technologies like React, Node.js or Django, PostgreSQL, and mapping tools for disease alerts. The app will have modules for risk assessment, training, alerts, record keeping, and dashboards. All data will sync to the cloud and work even with low internet.

## Feasibility and Viability

The solution is easy to develop using available technologies and can be used by farmers with basic smartphones. It is cost-effective and scalable across rural India. The main challenges are low digital literacy and weak internet, but we solve this through an offline mode and simple interfaces.

## Impact and Benefits

The portal improves farmer awareness, reduces disease outbreaks, and increases farm productivity. It helps farmers save money by preventing losses. It also supports government departments with better disease monitoring, data analytics, and faster response. Overall, it strengthens the livestock sector.

## Research and References

We referred to biosecurity guidelines from the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying, FAO biosecurity manuals, ICAR documents, and existing farm management tools. These helped us design a practical and effective digital solution.
